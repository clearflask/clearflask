# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Smotana, we have a few fundamental principles:

* We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect
  about you through the operation of our services.
* We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
* We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or
  kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
* We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
* We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

### Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

We (the [folks at Smotana](https://smotana.com)) are on a mission to provide useful software for both our customers and
users. We hope you love our products and services as much as we love creating them. This Privacy Policy ("Policy"")
describes how Smotana gathers, uses, discloses, and manages your data. Please read this carefully and reach out to us if
you have any questions at our [email](mailto:legal@example.com). This Policy is available under
a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license originally created by the
amazing [folks at Automattic](http://automattic.com/about/). You’re more than welcome to copy, adapt, and repurpose this
policy for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your Policy reflects your actual practices. This
Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

* Our Sites (including Smotana.com, ClearFlask.com, and Veruv.com);
* Our other Smotana products, services, and features that are available on or through Our Sites; and
* Other users’ websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us.

This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Smotana. Throughout this Privacy
Policy we’ll refer to our websites, and other products and services collectively as "Services." And if you’d like to
learn more about which Smotana company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on
Controllers and Responsible Companies. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with
the choices that you have with respect to that information.

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to
communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you
provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the
information that we collect.

#### _Information You Provide to Us_

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:

* **Basic account information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.
* **Public profile information:** If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your
  public profile.
* **Payment and contact information:** If you buy something from us or earn revenue through your platform, we’ll collect
  information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us, you’ll provide additional
  personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a
  record of the purchases you’ve made.
* **Content information:** You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post
  or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).
* **Communications with us:** You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, post a question in
  our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, Our Site's
  comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable
  law).
* **Job applicant information:** If you apply for a job with us, you may provide us with information like your name,
  contact information, resume or CV, and work authorization verification as part of the application process.

#### _Information We Collect Automatically_

We also collect some information automatically:

* **Log information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, and servers
  typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference,
  referring site, the date and time of access, and operating system. We collect log information when you use our
  Services.
* **Usage information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. We use this information to, for
  example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better,
  and understand and make predictions about user retention.
* **Location information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect
  and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic
  regions.
* **Interactions with other users’ sites:** We collect some information about your interactions with other users’ sites
  while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your "Expressions" and the fact that you commented on a
  particular post.
* **Information from cookies & other technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
  visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (
  also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Smotana may use cookies and other
  technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services,
  as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness.

#### _Information We Collect from Other Sources_

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log in to Our Site's account
through another service or if you connect your website or account to a social media service through, we’ll receive
information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization
procedures for that service. The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options
are available. Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet
our users. We use this information for marketing purposes.

### How and Why We Use Information

#### _Purposes for Using Information_

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

* **To provide our Services.** For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore
  your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.
* **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new
  versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can
  create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more
  efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
* **To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.** For example, by
  targeting our marketing messageModels to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have
  been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (
  like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing messageModel), and understanding and
  forecasting user retention.
* **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and
  protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal
  obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Smotana and others, which may result in us, for example,
  declining a transaction or terminating Services.
* **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
* **To customize the user experience.** For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant
  notifications and advertisements for our Services.
* **To communicate with you.** For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most
  out of our products, or keep you up to date on Smotana; texting you to verify your payment. If you don’t want to hear
  from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important
  updates relating to your account.)
* **To recruit and hire new employees.** For example, by evaluating job applicants and communicating with them.

#### _Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information_

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data
protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in
order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is
necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge
you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in
order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your
information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even
better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the
effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any
problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent.

### Sharing Information

#### _How We Share Information_

We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

* **Subsidiaries and independent contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and
  independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our
  behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal
  information that we share with them.
* **Third-party vendors:** We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order
  to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you. This includes vendors that help us provide our
  Services to you (like our payment processor, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment
  transactions, cloud storage services, and customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you);
  those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target
  group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand
  and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like
  programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and
  collaboration among our teams); and other third-party tools that help us manage operations. We require vendors to
  agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
* **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order,
  or other governmental request
* **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that
  disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Smotana, third parties, or the public at
  large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical
  injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
* **Business transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of
  our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Smotana goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
  information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events
  were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your
  information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
* **With your consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we
  may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so.
* **Aggregated or de-identified information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so
  that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the
  use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other
  platforms.
* **Published support requests:** If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of
  our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your
  request, or to help us support other users.

We have a policy that we do not sell our users' data. We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information
to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.

#### _Information Shared Publicly_

Information that you choose to make public is disclosed publicly. That means information like your public profile,
posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your "Expressions" and comments on other websites are all
available to others — and we hope they get a lot of views! Public information may also be indexed by search engines or
used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.

### How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it —
described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it. For
example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Our Sites, like the visitor’s IP
address, browser type, and operating system. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things,
analyze traffic to Smotana’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.

### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access,
use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential
vulnerabilities and attacks.

### Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

* **Limit the information that you provide:** If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional
  account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do
  not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.
* **Opt out of marketing communications:** You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow
  the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still
  send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
* **Set your browser to reject cookies:** At this time, Smotana does not respond to "do not track" signals across all of
  our Services. However, you can set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Smotana’s websites,
  with the drawback that certain features of Smotana’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
* **Close your account:** While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use
  our Services. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as
  described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply
  with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for
  our legitimate business interests.

### Your Rights

If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the
European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the "GDPR"), you may have certain rights regarding your personal
information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.

#### _European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_

If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights
with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:

* Request access to your personal data;
* Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
* Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
* Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
* Request portability of your personal data.

You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.

#### _California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)_

The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") requires us to provide California residents with some additional
information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information,
and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the "categories" of personal information we
collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following
categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:

* Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
* Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
* Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);
* Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you
  take as an administrator of a ClearFlask.com account);
* Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
* Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
* Professional or employment-related information (for example, your information you provide in a job application); and
* Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).

If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the
law, including the right to:

* Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose
  for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third
  parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;
* Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
* Opt out of any sale of personal information; and
* Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.

#### _Contacting Us About These Rights_

You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but
if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to "How to Reach Us" to
find out how to reach us. When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you
are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact
us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on
your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.

### Controllers and Responsible Companies

Smotana’s Services are worldwide. Different Smotana companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal
information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular
service and the location of the individual using our Services. Depending on the Services you use, more than one company
may be the controller of your personal data. Generally, the "controller" is the Smotana company that entered into the
contract with you under the Terms of Service for the product or service you use. In addition, Smotana is the controller
for all of the processing activities across all of our Services worldwide.

### How to Reach Us

If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in
this Policy, please contact us via [email](mailto:legal@smotana.com).

### Other Things You Should Know

#### _Transferring Information_

Because Smotana’s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in
the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work
for us, other members of our group of companies, or third-party data processors. This is required for the purposes
listed in the "How and Why We Use Information" section above. When providing information about you to entities outside
the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in
accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include:

* In the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with
  them, or ensuring they have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome); or
* In the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard
  contractual arrangements with them.

You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it
from the EU.

#### _Third-Party Software and Services_

If you’d like to use third-party plugins that enable services provided by third parties, or other third-party software
or services, please keep in mind that interacting with them may mean providing information about yourself (or your site
visitors) to those third parties. For example, some third-party services may request or require access to your (yours,
your visitors’, or customers’) data via a pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third-party service or grant
access, your data will be handled in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy and practices. We don’t own or
control these third parties, and they have their own rules about information collection, use, and sharing, which you
should review before using the software or services.

#### _Visitors to Our Users’ Websites_

We also process information about visitors to our users’ websites, on behalf of our users and in accordance with our
user agreements. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for their websites is
covered by this Privacy Policy unless it has been overriden by you via a custom Privacy Policy such as on your Platform.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Smotana may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Smotana
encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will
notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a
statement to our homepage, blog or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the
Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy

### Translation

Our Privacy Policy was originally written in English (US). We may translate it into other languages. In the event of a
conflict between a translated version of our Privacy Policy and the English version, the English version will control.

That’s it! Thanks for reading.
