# Terms of Service

## The Gist

We (the [folks at Smotana](https://smotana.com)) are on a mission to provide useful software for both our customers and
users. We hope you love our products and services as much as we love creating them. These Terms of Service ("Terms")
describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them
carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions at our [email](mailto:legal@example.com). These Terms are
available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license originally
created by the amazing [folks at Automattic](http://automattic.com/about/). You’re more than welcome to copy them, adapt
them, and repurpose them for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your Terms reflect your actual
practices.

## Terms

These Terms govern your access to and use of Smotana.com, Veruv.com, and ClearFlask.com (collectively, the "Sites", "
Service Sites", or "Our Sites"), as well as all content, products and services available at or through these websites (
collectively, "Services"). These Terms also govern visitors’ access to and use of any websites that use our Services,
such as content hosted on Our Sites that are operated by our users. Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance,
without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (
including, without limitation, [Smotana’s Privacy Policy](https://smotana.com/privacy/)), and procedures that may be
published from time to time by Smotana (collectively, the "Agreement"). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our
Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades. Please read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using
our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not
agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.

## 1\. Who’s Who

Throughout these Terms, "you" applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our Services. If you are an
individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that
entity to the Agreement and that by using our Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity. Your
Agreement is with Smotana. We refer to Smotana collectively as "we" throughout these Terms.

## 2\. Your Account

Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you
register for an account and keep the information current. This is important because sometimes we may need to send you
notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or we may want to let you know
about and make informed choices in response to legal inquiries or complaints.

You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account. You are responsible for
keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related website, store, or other
content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in
connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of
any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for
any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

When you create an account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may
contact you to share more details about what we have to offer. Don't worry -- if you aren't interested in learning more,
you can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it's an email, phone call, or text messageModel.

## 3\. Minimum Age Requirements

Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16
in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who
registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or
older (or 16 years or older in the European Union).

## 4\. Responsibility of Visitors and Users

We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content (such as, but not limited to, text, photo, video, audio,
code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our Services by users or anyone else ("Content")
and are not responsible for any use or effects of such Content. So, for example:

* We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Content could be
  offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or
  violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights (see our Copyright Infringement and
  DMCA Policy section to submit copyright complaints), or other proprietary rights of third parties.
* If you post Content, comment on a website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) Content available on
  our Services, you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.
* We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone’s use, purchase, or downloading of Content. If you
  access or use any Content, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your
  computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
* Any Content offered for sale through any of our Services are the seller’s sole responsibility, and you agree that you
  will look solely to the seller for any damages that result from your purchase or use of Content.
* We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions,
  interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.
* Please note that additional third party terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying, purchase, or use
  of Content.

We also have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through
the websites and web pages that link to, or are linked from, Our Sites or our other Services. For example:

* We do not have any control over those websites and are not responsible for their contents or their use.
* The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website.

  worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
* We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from non-Smotana websites.

## 5\. Fees, Payment, and Renewal

### a. Smotana Fees

**Fees for Paid Services.** Some of our Services are offered for a fee, such as ClearFlask.com plans (collectively, "
Paid Services"). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees (for
example, [ClearFlask fees](https://ClearFlask.com/)). Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees,
recurring fees, or revenue-based fees. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular
automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which
you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team. For revenue-based fees you pay us a percentage of the
revenue your website generates. Revenue-based fees are ongoing.

**Taxes.** To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable
federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or
charges now in force or enacted in the future ("Taxes"). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes
relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on
the Fees you’ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.

**Payment.** If your payment fails or if Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, we may
immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to
decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.

**Automatic Renewal.** To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means
that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew,
and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the
then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same
interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if you purchase a ClearFlask.com annual plan, you
will be charged each year for the following 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end
of the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or
other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic
renewal is determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. You can view your
renewal date for ClearFlask.com Paid Services by visiting your [Billing page](https://ClearFlask.com/dashboard/billing).

**Cancelling Automatic Renewal.** You can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service’s site. For
example, you can manage all of your ClearFlask.com plans through your
ClearFlask.com [Billing page](https://ClearFlask.com/dashboard/billing). To cancel a ClearFlask.com plan, follow the
instructions on the Billing page. You must repeat this process for each subscription you wish to cancel.

**Fee Changes.** We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously free. When
applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel
your Paid Service.

**Refunds.** While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless
otherwise required by applicable law.

## 6\. General Representation and Warranty

You represent and warrant that your use of our Services:

* Will be in strict accordance with these Terms;
* Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, all applicable laws regarding
  online conduct and acceptable content, privacy, data protection, the transmission of technical data exported from the
  United States or the country in which you reside, the use of financial services, notification and consumer protection,
  unfair competition, and false advertising);
* Will not use the Services for any unlawful purposes, to publish illegal content, or in furtherance of illegal
  activities;
* Will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party;
* Will not overburden Smotana’s systems, as determined by us in our sole discretion;

you believe that material located on or associated with a Smotana product or service violates your copyright, please
notify us by [email](mailto:dmca@smotana.com). We will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate
by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor’s

the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Smotana or others. In the case of such termination, we will have
no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.

## 9\. Intellectual Property

The Agreement does not transfer from Smotana to you any Smotana or third party intellectual property, and all right,
title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Smotana. Smotana, Our Sites
logos, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with Our Sites or our Services,

that:

* Third Party Services are not vetted, endorsed, or controlled by Smotana.
* Any use of a Third Party Service is at your own risk, and we shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for Third
  Party Services.

  Party’s terms and policies. It is your responsibility to review the Third Party’s terms and policies before using a
  Third Party Service.

In rare cases, we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third Party Services from your account or website.

## 11\. Changes

We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our
Services are offered. These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of
Smotana, or by the posting by Smotana of a revised version. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know
by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The
notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our
changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or once the changes become
effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before
the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when
the dispute arose.

## 12\. Termination

We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without
notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim
your username or name due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion,
violates any Smotana policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make some adjustments, restrict
the resources you use, or terminate your Services, if we believe your storage or bandwidth usage is out of hand and/or
burdens our systems, or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for
any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

If you wish to terminate the Agreement or your Site account, you may simply discontinue using our Services, or, if you
are using a paid service, you may cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section in these Terms.

All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including,
without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

Plans marked as "lifetime" are plans that can be used under the same initial terms forever unless a termination event
occurs. If a termination event occurs, you may be refunded a linearly prorated amount from the purchase date until ten
years later after purchase.

a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.

## 20\. Miscellaneous

The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Smotana and you concerning the subject matter hereof. If any part
of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent,
and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of
the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach
thereof. You may assign your rights under the Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its
terms and conditions; Smotana may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. The Agreement will be binding
upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
